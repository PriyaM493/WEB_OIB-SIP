        When we talk about the Mahabharata, we fondly recall Lord Krishna, Arjuna, and Yudhisther.
         And then there are the Kauravas, the bad guys. The character we talk about the least is Karna - 
         the ill-fated guy, the low-born king and the man who was accidentally cursed several times. 
         But the role of Karna's in the Mahabharata is important all the same.
         Here are some lesser known stories about the 'suryaputra',
         proving he was nothing less than a hero.

        Once, Arjuna asked Lord Krishna why he called Yudhishtira, Dharamaraj, and Karna, Daanveer. To answer this question, Krishna disguised himself and Arjuna as Brahmins and decided to visit both the
        kings. On visiting Yudhishitra, they asked for sandalwood to cook food. It was raining heavily at the time,
        and Yudhishitra couldn't find dry sandalwood suitable to be used as a fuel. He apologised to both of them,
        and they returned empty handed.
        A little later, they went to Karna and asked for the same thing. Karna searched everywhere for dry
        sandalwood but failed. But he did not let the Brahmins go home empty handed. He picked up his bow and arrow
        and destroyed the doors made of sandalwood. This, he gave to Krishna and Arjuna.

        Karna was cursed by Rishi Parusharam even though he was aware of his true heritage.
        Rishi Parusharam cursed Karna for deceiving him. Karna had claimed he was a Brahmin, which was a lie.
        He had lied so that he could learn archery from the greatest teacher of all time. But it backfired. 
        In reality however, Parusharam knew about Karna's true heritage.But he also knew the big picture that would be played out later.

        Karna wasn't drawn to Duryodhan only by dharma. 
        After Karna's coronation as Angh Raj, he spent most of his time with Duryodhana. 
        They would play a game of dice in the evening. One day after sunset, Duryodhana had to leave momentarily.
        His wife Bhanumati, who was passing by, saw Karna waiting for her husband and decided to continue her 
        husband's game. At some point they had a casual quarrel about whose turn it was next. Playfully, Karna 
        tried to snatch the dice from her hand. While they were wriggling, Bhanumati's dress shifted out of place, 
        and her pearl necklace broke. The pearls scattered everywhere on the floor. At that instant, Duryodhana
        entered and found his wife with his friend in a compromising position, with their clothes entangled and 
        pearls all over the floor. Duryodhana asked Karna what the quarrelling was for. 
        Upon knowing the reason he cracked a joke and laughed aloud and continued playing.
        Later, when Bhanumati asked Duryodhana why he didn't doubt her, he replied, "In a relation there is no scope
        for doubt, for when doubt settles in there will be no relation.Karna is my best friend and I trust him 
        because I have faith that he will never break my trust.
